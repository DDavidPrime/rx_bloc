A brick designed to integrate social login with Apple, Google and Facebook functionality into our application.

### Apple Authentication
It uses the [sign_in_with_apple][5] package. In order to make it work, fulfill the requirements described in its documentation.
When you run the created project, don't forget to enable the "Sign in with Apple" capability for your bundleId.

Supports iOS.

### Google Authentication
Google authentication uses [google_sign_in][6] package.
 
Follow the package documentation for registering your application and downloading Google Services file.(GoogleService-Info.plist/google-services.json)

`Android:`
For android integration you will need to copy ***google-services.json*** file to ***android/app/src/{name_of_the_environment}/*** 

`iOS:`
For iOS integration you will need to copy ***GoogleService-Info.plist*** file to ***ios/enviroments/{name_of_the_enviroment}/firebase/***

For any other configurations refer to the [google_sign_in][6] package.

### Facebook Authentication
Facebook authentication uses [flutter_facebook_auth][7] package.

`Step 1:`  
In order to make it work you must register your app in facebook developer console.

`Step 2:`  
There you will find your **app_id**, **client_token** and **app_name**.

`Step 3:`
- `3.1 Android:` Copy parameters from step 2 in ***android/app/build.gradle***.

- `3.2 iOS:`
  Copy parameters from step 2 in ***ios/Flutter/(flavor-name).xcconfig***.


`Note:` Some requirements to be able to run application with this version of *facebook auth* is
- **flutter_secure_storage** package must be 8.0.0 version
- for iOs in ***Podfile*** platform must be at least 12
