Dev menu package is a useful package when it comes to debugging your app and/or easily accessing some common development specific information and settings. You can define secret inputs which after being triggered a defined number of times will execute a callback. From that callback you can define any app-specific behaviors like navigating to a screen, displaying a dev modal sheet with additional data or your own behaviors.

## Widgets

Within the `prime_dev_menu` package you can find the `DevMenuListener` widget and the `showDevMenuBottomSheet` function.

### DevMenuListener

The `DevMenuListener` widget is a widget that is listening for user interactions (quick taps or long taps) and as a result executes a callback (`onDevMenuPresented`) once a certain amount of interactions has been made.

You can define which type of interactions you want to register by toggling the value of the `triggerWithLongPress` field (defaults to `false` which means that quick user taps will be registered, unlike when the value is set to `true` which will react to long user taps).

With the `enabled` field, you can customize when the user interactions will be triggered and the callback is executed. If set to `false`, the widget will not fire any events. This can be useful to limit the execution of the development/debug related code only while in debug mode and prevent any code running in release mode or under any specified conditions.

The widget is dependent on the `DevMenuBloc` which is an essential part of the system. The mentioned bloc should be registered with a provider in the widget tree above the widget which is trying to access it. The `DevMenuBloc` contains the necessary logic for registering and emitting stream events after a specific number of taps has been made. By default that number is 5 taps, but a custom number can be specified (by setting the `maxTaps` value when instantiating the bloc). The `DevMenuDependencies.from` factory can be used to define all necessary dependencies which can be accessed from the `providers` field.

The `DevMenuListener` widget comes with a static method called `DevMenuListener.withDependencies` which allows you to easily and on-the-go define a widget with the necessary dependencies. It will instantiate and properly nest a child widget within a MultiProvider for you. The hitbox of the `child` widget will be used to trigger any interactions within the bloc.

As a good use case, you can wrap your page widget with this widget so you are able to access the functionality while on the same page.

```dart
DevMenuListener.withDependencies(
  triggerWithLongPress: true,
  maxTaps: 3,
  onDevMenuPresented: (){
    showDevMenuBottomSheet(
      context: context,
      builder: (context) => MyDevMenuWidget(),
    );
  },
  child: HomePage(),
)

```

### `showDevMenuBottomSheet`

The `showDevMenuBottomSheet` function is a convenience function for displaying a DevMenu modal sheet with some pre-configured options. It requires a `builder` function which takes a `BuildContext` and returns a `Widget` which will be displayed within the modal sheet.

It works great when incorporated with the `DevMenuListener` widget within the `onDevMenuPresented` callback.

As part of the dev menu modal sheet, there is a customizable `options` parameter which requires a `DevMenuConfig` class. That config class allows you to customize different aspects and features of the dev menu and as well turn on/off some options.
